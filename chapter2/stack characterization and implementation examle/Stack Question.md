# Stack Question - Interface and Specification Implementation

Define and implement a stack structure. The interface to work with the stack includes the following procedures:

***empty-stack, push, pop, top, empty-stack?***

### Part 1
a) Write down an algebraic specification for each of the above operations regardless of any implementation. (Similar to what appears on page 36 of the textbook).

Also, indicate for each action whether it is a constructor or an observer.

### Part 2

b) Implement the specification of the stack, using define-datatype.
